## Run Remote Apps on a Network


</div>

### Description

This demo project shows one way to easily send a program to another computer on your LAN and run it remotely. Sound impossible? Actually it is pretty easy. I have seen several questions on how to do this recently on the discussion boards

and decided to show and easy way. NOTE: THIS IS A DEMO APPLICATION. I know it has some shortcomings and a lack of features...but simple is better for demos. It works. Feel free to use it and spiff it up if you like. Some possible enhancements could be adding the ability to display an image, play a sound, or print a document on remote machines. Network admins should especially have a lot of ideas on how this could be used for maintenance and inventory.

Please read the README before posting any comments or questions. If you ask about something that was covered in the ReadMe file, I will make fun of you.
 
### More Info
 
This project file contains two VERY SMALL application project folders. Extract them both. Change the share folder and exe folder settings in the client application to your liking.

NOTE: THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU SHARE A FOLDER ON THE CLIENT COMPUTER! The actual folder name should be set as the "strListenFolder" setting in the client application.

Also, create a "Exe" folder to hold the application as it executes and put that path in the client as "strExeFolder"

Once you get the folder information set, compile both applications. Run the client one on the client computer and the server one on your computer. When you send a file from your computer, the client should run it within 10 seconds.
